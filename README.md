### Purpose

This project came about after going to the gym one day. I overheard two gentlemen (A & B) arguing over who was actually stronger. Objectively, A was stronger because he could bench a larger number but B was about 10 years older and much smaller. B was clearly a runner and A was a power lifter.

Although we can all agree that A is objectively stronger, if you factor in the handicaps of gender, weight, age, etc. is he really that much stronger?

I created this utility to find out. After a substatial amout of research, I developed an algorithm that should even the playing field a litte.
